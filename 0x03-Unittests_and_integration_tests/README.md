# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project focuses on writing **unit tests** and **integration tests** in Python. You will learn how to apply testing techniques like **mocking**, **parameterization**, and **fixtures**, while also understanding the differences between unit and integration testing.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts clearly:

- The difference between unit and integration tests.
- Common testing patterns such as:
  - Mocking
  - Parametrization
  - Fixtures
- How to use the `unittest` and `unittest.mock` libraries.
- How to structure tests to ensure your functions work correctly and reliably.
- Best practices in writing readable, maintainable test cases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Code follows the **pycodestyle** (PEP8) style guide (version 2.5).
- All modules, classes, and functions are documented with proper docstrings.
- All functions and coroutines are type-annotated.
- All files are executable and end with a new line.
