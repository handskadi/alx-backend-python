# Project Setup

To start the project, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers:

    docker compose up --build
    ```

This command will build the necessary images and start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
